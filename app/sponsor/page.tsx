              Apart from competitive robotics, we also have many outreach programs. We teach SPIKE lego robotics to john sinnot elementery school students. We have also founded the M.A.R.S. program, which is robotics workshop for elementary school students across MUSD. We also enhance our school spirit by participating in school events and activities. We recently created a ferris wheel for the school's homecoming event. For more details, visit our blog!
